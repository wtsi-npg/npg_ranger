release 0.1
  - Initial version:
    a node.js server running on a socket or on a port serving
      either individual files or merging all available files
      for a sample,
    a range to serve and data format to serve can be specified,
    mongodb is used to find file locations,
    authorization is switched on by default (can be disabled),
      relies on authentication done elsewhere (the incoming request
      should have X-Remote-User header set), so this server
      should be run behind a reverse proxy that will perform
      authentication and set the header,
    'data_truncated' trailer header is set to 'false' if the data
      processing pipeline completed successfully, in case of an
      error in the pipeline it is set to 'true'.
